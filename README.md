# Syedz Token (SyT)

Syedz Token (SyT) is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. It follows the standard ERC-20 protocol, ensuring compatibility with various wallets and exchanges. SYT is designed for easy transfers and transactions, allowing users to send, receive, and approve tokens effortlessly. With features like minting new tokens and burning existing ones, SYT provides flexibility and control over the token supply.

This project serves as a basic demonstration of token functionality using Flask, where token minting, burning, and all the other functionalities are showcased in a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Transfer Tokens**: Easily transfer SYT tokens between accounts.
- **Approve and Transfer From**: Approve third-party accounts to transfer tokens on your behalf and execute transfers.
- **Mint Tokens**: Create new tokens and add them to the total supply.
- **Burn Tokens**: Destroy tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **Check Balances**: View the balance of any account.
- **Check Allowances**: View how much a third-party account is approved to transfer on your behalf.

These features empower users to manage their token holdings effectively, enabling seamless transactions and token management on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Structure

- **Smart Contract**: Contains Solidity code defining the Syedz Token contract, including functions and event emissions.
- **Web3 Python Scripts**: Utilizes the Web3 library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Includes functionalities for deploying contracts, interacting with tokens, and querying blockchain data.
- **Flask Web Application**: Demonstrates token functionalities via a basic web interface built using Flask. Users can perform actions such as transferring tokens, checking balances, and approving token allowances.

This project serves as a practical example of an ERC-20 token implementation and provides insights into token systems on the Ethereum blockchain.
